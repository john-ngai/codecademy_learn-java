# Introduction to Methods

Methods are repeatable, modular blocks of code used to accomplish specific tasks. Through *method decomposition*, we can use methods to break down a large problem into smaller, more manageable problems.

*Procedural abstraction* is the concept of knowing what a method does, but not how it accomplishes it. The ability to use procedural abstraction in programming is fundamental to designing clean, readable, and maintable code.

# Defining Methods

**Example** - Defining a `checkBalance()` method:

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  double balance;
  
  ...

  public void checkBalance(){
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }
}
```

The first line, `public void checkBalance()`, is the method declaration:

* `public` means that other classes can access this method.
* The `void` keyword means that there is no specific output (return) from the method.
* `checkBalance()` is the name of the method.

**Reminder:** Every method has its own unique *method signature* which is comprised of the method’s name and its parameter type. In the above example, the method signature is `checkBalance()`.

**Note:** `checkBalance()` is considered a *non-static method* because it's signature does not include the keyword `static` like the `main()` method does.

<br>

# Calling Methods

When we add a **non-static method** to a class, it becomes available to use on an object of that class. 

**Example** - Calling the `startEngine()` method on a `MyFastCar` object:

```java
class Car {
  String color;
 
  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
  }
 
  public void startEngine() {
    System.out.println("Starting the car!");
    System.out.println("Vroom!");
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Car myFastCar = new Car("red");

    // Call a method on an object
    myFastCar.startEngine();
    System.out.println("That was one fast car!");
  }
}
```

If we run the above program, we will get the following output:

```
Starting the car!
Vroom!
That was one fast car!
```

<br>

# Scope

A method is a task that an object of a class performs.

We mark the domain of a task using curly braces:  `{` , and  `}` . This domain is called the *scope of a method*.

We **can’t access** variables that are declared **inside** a method that is **outside** the scope of that method.

For example, given a `Car` class:

```java
class Car {
  String color;
  int milesDriven;
 
  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
    milesDriven = 0;         
  }
 
  public void drive() {
     String message = "Miles driven: " + milesDriven;
     System.out.println(message);
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
     Car myFastCar = new Car("red");
     myFastCar.drive();
  }
}
```

The variable `message`, which is declared and initialized inside of `drive()`, cannot be used inside of `main()`.

However, `milesDriven`, which is declared at the top of the class, can be used inside all methods within the class.

<br>

# Adding Parameters

Similar to how we added parameters to *constructors*, we can customize all other methods to accept parameters.

**Example** - Adding two parameters to a `startRadio()` method:

```java
public void startRadio(double stationNum, String stationName) {
  System.out.println("Turning on the radio to " + stationNum + ", " + stationName + "!");
  System.out.println("Enjoy!");
}
```

**Note:** Adding parameter values will impact the method’s signature (i.e., `startRadio(double, String)`).

<br>

# Reassigning Instance Fields

We can reassign the value of instance fields using methods:

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  double balance;

  ...

  // Now, when we call deposit(), it should change the value of the balance instance field:
  public void deposit(double amountToDeposit){
    double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
    balance = updatedBalance;
  }
}
```

Changing instance fields is how we change the state of an object and make our objects more flexible and realistic.

<br>

# Returns

## Returning Primitive Values

We return a value by using the keyword `return`:

```java
public int numberOfTires() {
   int tires = 4;

   return tires; // return statement
}
```

In previous examples, new methods were created using the keyword `void`. Here, we are replacing `void` with `int`, to signify that the *return type* is an `int`.

We can use datatype keywords (such as `int`, `char`, etc.) to specify the type of value the method should return. The return value’s type **must** match the return type of the method. 

Unlike void methods, non-void methods can be used as either **1)** a variable value, or **2)** as part of an expression:

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  Car myCar = new Car("red");
  int numTires = myCar.numberOfTires();
}
```

## Returning an Object

When we return a primitive value, a copy of the value is returned. However, when we return an object, we return a **reference to the object** instead of a copy of it.

For example, given the following `CarLot` class:

```java
class CarLot {
  Car carInLot;
  public CarLot(Car givenCar) {
    carInLot = givenCar;
  }
 
  public Car returnACar() {
    return carInLot; // returns a Car object
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // This uses constructor from the Car class delared in the previous example.
    Car myCar = new Car("red", 70);
    System.out.println(myCar);

    CarLot myCarLot = new CarLot(myCar);
    System.out.println(myCarLot.returnACar());
  }
}
```

This code outputs the same memory address because `myCar` and `carInLot` have the same reference value:

```
Car@2f333739
Car@2f333739
```

<br>

# The toString() Method

When we print out objects, the Java compiler internally invokes a `toString()` method on the object, which often outputs a `String` that is not very helpful in determining what the object represents (e.g. `Store@6bc7c054`). This doesn't tell us anything about the instance fields defined within the object.

However, when we explicitly define a `toString()` method for a class, we can overrride the built-in `toString()` method, and return a more helpful `String` when we print the object:

```java
class Car {
  String color;
 
  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Car myCar = new Car("red");
    System.out.println(myCar);
  }
 
  public String toString(){
    return "This is a " + color + " car!";
  }
}
```

When this runs, the command `System.out.println(myCar)` will print `This is a red car!`, which tells us more useful information about the `myCar` object.
