# Static Methods

Static methods are methods that belong to an entire class, not a specific object of the class. Static methods are called using the class name and the `.` operator.

**Example** - Calling different static methods:

```java
double randomNumber = Math.random();
// Stores a random decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 in randomNumber
 
double number = Double.valueOf("2.5");
// Transforms the String "2.5" into a double
```

# Static Variables

Similar to static methods, static variables as belong to the class itself instead of belonging to a particular object of the class. Static variables are also accessed using the name of the class and the `.` operator.

**Example** - Static variables & instance variables:

```java
public class Dog{
 
  // Static variables
  public static String genus = "Canis";
 
  //Instance variables
  public int age;
  public String name;
 
  public Dog(int inputAge, String inputName){
    this.age = inputAge;
    this.name = inputName;
  }
}
```

Since all dogs share the same `genus`, we could use a static variable to store that information for the entire class. However, we want each dog to have it’s own unique `name` and `age`, so those aren’t `static`. We could now access this static variable in a `main()` function like so:

```java
public class Dog{

  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println(Dog.genus); // Output: Canis
  }
}
```

Unlike static methods, you can still access static variables from a specific object of the class. However, no matter what object you use to access the variable, the value will always be the same:

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  Dog snoopy = new Dog(3, "Snoopy");
  Dog ringo = new Dog(5, "Ringo");
 
  System.out.println(Dog.genus); // Output: Canis
  System.out.println(snoopy.genus); // Output: Canis
  System.out.println(ringo.genus); // Output: Canis
}
```

# Modifying Static Variables

Editing static variables is similar to editing any other variable. Whether you’re writing code in a constructor, a non-static method, or a static method, you have access to static variables.

**Example** - Modifying the `numATMs` static variable inside the constructor method:

```java
public class ATM{
  // Static variables
  public static int totalMoney = 0;
  public static int numATMs = 0;

  // Instance variables
  public int money;

  public ATM(int inputMoney){
    this.money = inputMoney;

    // Incrementing the value of numATMs each time a new instance/object is created
    numATMs++;
  }
}
```
