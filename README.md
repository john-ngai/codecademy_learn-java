# Course Notes - [Learn Java by Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/)

## Preface

I primarily created these notes for myself to reference. However, I'm also publishing them on GitHub for anyone else who might find some value out of it.

These notes were written assuming you have some basic understanding of programming, and do not cover many of the details that are common amongst multiple programming languages. Instead, these notes mostly cover the details that are unique to Java itself.
