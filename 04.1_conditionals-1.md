# Introduction to Control Flow

*Conditional* or *control flow* statements check a boolean condition and run a block of code depending on the condition.

<br>

# If-Then

```java
// Output: Hello World!
if (true) {
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
}

// Output:
if (false) {
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

If a conditional is brief we can omit the curly braces entirely:

```java
if (true) System.out.println("Brevity is the soul of wit");
```

<br>

# If-Then-Else

This conditional statement ensures that exactly one code block will be run. If the condition is `false`, the block after `else` runs:

```java
if (hasPrerequisite) {
  // Enroll in course
} else {
  // Enroll in prerequisite
}
```

<br>

# If-Then-Else-If

The conditional structure weâ€™ve learned can be chained together to check as many conditions as are required by our program:

```java
int testScore = 72;

// Output: C
if (testScore >= 90) {
  System.out.println("A");
} else if (testScore >= 80) {
  System.out.println("B");
} else if (testScore >= 70) {
  System.out.println("C");
} else if (testScore >= 60) {
  System.out.println("D");
} else {
  System.out.println("F");
}
```

The first condition to evaluate to `true` will have that code block run. In this case, `testScore >= 70` comes before `testScore >= 60`, so only the earlier code block is run.

<br>

# Nested Conditional Statements

We can create more complex conditional structures by creating *nested conditional statements*, which is created by placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements:

```java
if (outerCondition) {
  if (nestedCondition) {
    // Instruction to execute if both conditions are true...
  }
}
```

<br>

# Switch Statement

An alternative to chaining if-then-else conditions together is to use the `switch` statement. This conditional will check a given value against any number of conditions and run the code block where there is a match.

**Example** - A course selection conditional as a `switch` statement:

```java
String course = "History";
 
switch (course) {
  case "Algebra": 
    // Enroll in Algebra
    break; 
  case "Biology": 
    // Enroll in Biology
    break;
  case "History": 
    // Enroll in History
    break;
  case "Theatre":
    // Enroll in Theatre
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Course not found");
}
```

When no value matches, the `default` block runs. Think of this as the `else` equivalent.

The `break` keyword is used to exit the switch statement.

**Important:** Without `break`, code below the matching `case` label is run, **including** code under the following case labels as well, which is rarely the desired behavior!
