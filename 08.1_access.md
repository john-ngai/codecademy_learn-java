# What are Access & Scope?

The concepts of access and scope both center around what parts of your programs can interact with specific variables or methods from other parts of your program.

## Access

* The `public` and `private` keywords and how they relate to Classes, variables, constructors, and methods.
* The concept of encapsulation.
* Accessor methods, sometimes known as “getters”.
* Mutator methods, sometimes known as “setters”.

## Scope

* Local variables vs. instance variables.
* The `this` keyword.

# The public Keyword

We can define the access of many different parts of our code including instance variables, methods, constructors, and even a class itself.

The way we declare something to be *public* is to use the `public` keyword in the declaration statement.

**Example** - A `public` class, constructor, instance variables, & method:

```java
public class Dog {
  public String name;
  public int age;
 
  public Dog(String input_name, int input_age){
    name = input_name;
    age = input_age;
  }
 
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Arf Arf! My name is " + name + " and I am a good dog!");
  }
```

Since everything about a `Dog` is `public`, **any other class** can access anything about a `Dog`.

<br>

# The private Keyword and Encapsulation

When the instance variables or methods with a class are marked as `private`, this means that you can only access those structures from elsewhere from **inside** that same class.

For example, given a `DogSchool` class:

```java
public class DogSchool{
 
  public void makeADog(){
    Dog cujo = new Dog("Cujo", 7);
    System.out.println(cujo.age);
    cujo.speak();
  }
}
```

`makeADog` is trying to directly access the `age` instance variable and `speak()` method from the `Dog` class. However, if those are marked as `private` in the `Dog` class, the `DogSchool` class **won’t** be able to do that.

<br>

# Accessor and Mutator Methods

When writing classes, we often make all of our instance variables `private`. However, we still might want some other classes to have access to them, we just don’t want those classes to know the *exact* variable name.

## Accessor (Getter) Method

To give other classes access to a private instance variable, we would write an *accessor method* (sometimes also known as a “getter” method):

```java
public class Dog{
  private String name;
 
  ...
 
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}
```

Even though the instance variable `name` is `private`, other classes could call the `public` method `getName()` which returns the value of that instance variable.

**Note:** Accessor methods **will always** be `public`, and will have a return type that matches the type of the instance variable they’re accessing.

## Mutator (Setter) Method

`private` instance variables often have *mutator methods* (sometimes known as “setters”):

```java
public class Dog{
  private String name;
 
  ...
 
  public void setName(String newName) {
    name = newName;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Dog myDog = new Dog("Cujo");
    myDog.setName("Lassie");
  }
}
```

**Note:** Mutator methods, or “setters”, often are `void` methods since they don’t return anything. They often have one parameter that is the same type as the variable they’re trying to change.

# Scope

## Local Variables

In addition to access modifiers, the scope of the variable also determines what parts of your code can access that variable.

The *scope* of a variable is determined by **where** the variable is declared.

For example, because instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any methods or constructors, all methods and constructors are within the scope of that variable.

Similarly, if we have a variable declared inside a method, that variable can only be used inside that method. The same is true for parameters. These variables are often called *local variables*.

This idea of scope extends to conditionals and loops as well. If you declare a variable inside the body of a conditional or in a loop, that variable can only be used inside that structure. This also includes the variable you’re using as your looping variable.

## The this Keyword

Often times when creating classes, programmers will create local variables with the same name as instance variables.

**Example** - Local variables with the same name as instance variables:

```java
public class Dog{
  public String name;
 
  public Dog(String inputName){
    name = inputName;
  }
  
  // The local variable, name, is the same as the instance variable, name
  public void speakNewName(String name){
    System.out.println("Hello, my new name is" + name);
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Dog myDog = new Dog("Winston");
    myDog.speakNewName("Darla"); // Prints "Darla" - "Winston" ignored
  }
}
```

**Note:** By default, Java refers to the local variable name.

If we wanted to access the instance variable and not the local variable, we could use the `this` keyword:

```java
public class Dog{
  public String name;
 
  public Dog(String inputName){
    name = inputName;
  }
 
  public void speakNewName(String name){
    // Using the 'this' keyword to refer to the local variable, name
    System.out.println("Hello, my new name is" + this.name);
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Dog a = new Dog("Fido");
    Dog b = new Dog("Odie");
 
    a.speakNewName("Winston");
    // "Fido", the instance variable of Dog a is printed. "Winston" is ignored
 
    b.speakNewName("Darla");
    // "Odie", the instance variable of Dog b is printed. "Darla" is ignored.
  }
}
```

The `this` keyword is a reference to the current object. In the above example, we used `this.name` in our `speakNewName()` method. This caused the method to print out the value stored in the instance variable name of whatever `Dog` Object called `speakNewName()`.

Oftentimes, you’ll see constructors have parameters with the same name as the instance variable. For example:

```java
public Dog(String name){
  this.name = name;
}
```

You can read this as “set `this` `Dog`‘s instance variable, `name`, equal to the variable passed into the constructor”.

While this naming is a common convention, it can also be confusing. So there’s nothing wrong with naming your parameters something else to be more clear. For example, sometimes you will see something like this instead:

```java
public Dog(String inputName){
  this.name = inputName;
}
```

**Note:** Using `this` to refer to instance variables isn't explicitly necessary. If there’s no local variable with the same name, Java will know to use the instance variable with that name. However, it's a good practice to use `this` when working with instance variables to avoid potential confusion.

## Using this With Methods

When defining methods, we can also use the `this` keyword to call other methods. Consider the following example:

```java
public class Computer{
  public int brightness;
  public int volume;
 
  public void setBrightness(int inputBrightness){
    this.brightness = inputBrightness;
  }
 
  public void setVolume(int inputVolume){
    this.volume = inputvolume;
  }
 
  public void resetSettings(){
    this.setBrightness(0);
    this.setVolume(0);
  }
}
```

The `resetSettings()` method calls other methods from the class. Usually it needs an object to call those methods. However, rather than creating a new object, we use `this` as the object.

What this means is that the object that calls `resetSettings()` will be used to call `setBrightness(0)` and `setVolume(0)`:

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  Computer myComputer = new Computer();
  myComputer.resetSettings();
}
```

`this` serves as a placeholder for whatever object was used to call the original method.

# Other Private Methods

Oftentimes, `private` methods are helper methods — that is to say that they’re methods that other, bigger methods use.

For example, for a `CheckingAccount` class, we might want a `public` method like `getAccountInformation()` that prints information like the name of the account owner, the amount of money in the account, and the amount of interest the account will make in a month. That way, another class, like a `Bank`, could call that `public` method to get all of that information quickly.

In order to get that information, we might want to break that larger method into several helper methods. For example, inside `getAccountInformation()`, we might want to call a function called `calculateNextMonthInterest()`. That helper method should probably be `private`. There’s no need for a `Bank` to call these smaller helper methods — instead, a `Bank` can call the one `public` method, and rely on that method to do all of the complicated work by calling smaller `private` methods.
