# Introduction to Arrays

An array holds a fixed number of values of **one type**.

In Java, arrays are *zero-index*.

# Explicitly Creating an Array

To create an array, we provide a name and declare the type of data it holds:

```java
double[] prices;
```

Just like with variables, we can also declare and *explicitly* initialize in the same line:

```java
String[] clothingItems = {"Tank Top", "Beanie", "Funny Socks", "Corduroys"};
```

# Importing Arrays

Normally when we print out an array, we see a memory address (e.g. `[Ljava.lang.String;@2aae9190`) that isn't very helpful in understanding what is contained within the array.

If we want to have a more descriptive printout of the array itself, we need a `toString()` method that is provided by the `Arrays` *package* in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
```

The `Arrays` package has many useful methods, including `Arrays.toString()`. When we pass an array into `Arrays.toString()`, we can see the contents of the array printed out:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
 
public class Lottery(){
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
    String betterPrintout = Arrays.toString(lotteryNumbers);
    
    System.out.println(betterPrintout);
    // Prints: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
  } 
}
```

<br>

# Get Element By Index

We use square brackets, `[` and `]`, to access data at a certain index:

```java
double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};

System.out.println(prices[1]); // Prints: 15.87
```

**Note:** If we try to access an element outside of its appropriate index range, we will receive an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.

<br>

# Creating an Empty Array

We can also create empty arrays and then fill the items one by one. Empty arrays have to be initialized with a fixed size:

```java
String[] menuItems = new Array[3];
```

**Important:** Once you declare this size, it **cannot** be changed! This array will always be of size `3`.

After declaring and initializing, we can set each index of the array to be a different item:

```java
menuItems[0] = "Veggie hot dog";
menuItems[1] = "Potato salad";
menuItems[2] = "Cornbread";
```

This group of commands has the same effect as assigning the entire array at once:

```java
String[] menuItems = {"Veggie hot dog", "Potato salad", "Cornbread"};
```

We can also change an item after it has been assigned:

```java
menuItems[2] = "Baked cauliflower";
```

<br>

# Length

To get the length of an array, we can access the `length` field of the array object:

```java
String[] menuItems = new String[5];
System.out.println(menuItems.length); // Prints: 5

double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
System.out.println(prices.length); // Prints: 4
```

<br>

# String[] args

Recall that, when we write `main()` methods for our programs, we use the parameter `String[] args`.

A `String[]` is an array made up of `String` values.

The `args` parameter contains the arguments that we pass in from the terminal when we run the class file. (So far, `args` has been empty.)

**Example** - Passing an argument to `main()` through the terminal:

Given the following `HelloYou` class:

```java
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);  
  }
}
```

When we run the file `HelloYou` in the terminal with an argument of `"Laura"`:

```
java HelloYou Laura
```

We get the output:

```
Hello Laura
```

The `String[] args` would be interpreted as an array with one element, `"Laura"`. Therfore, if we use `args[0]` in the main method, we can access that element like we did in `HelloYou`.
