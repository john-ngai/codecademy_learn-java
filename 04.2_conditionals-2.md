# Introduction to Conditional Operators

*Conditional operators* are operators that only use boolean values.

The three conditional operators that will be coveed are AND ( `&&` ), OR ( `||` ), and NOT ( `!` ).

<br>

# Conditional-And: &&

If the values on **both sides** are `true`, then the resulting value is `true`, otherwise the resulting value is `false`.

```java
// true
true && true

// false
false && true

// false
true && false

// false
false && false
```

<br>

# Conditional-Or: ||

If **either of the two values** are `true`, then the resulting value is `true`, otherwise the resulting value is `false`.

```java
// true
true || true

// true
false || true

// true
true || false

// false
false || false
```

# Short-Circuited Evaluation

On some occasions, the compiler can determine the truth value of a logical expression by only evaluating the first boolean operand; this is known as *short-circuited evaluation*. Short-circuited evaluation only works with expressions that use `&&` or `||`.

In an expression that uses `||`, if the first operand of an expression is `true`, the compiler will stop before reading the other operand since we don't need to see it's value to know that the final value will also be `true`.

Similarly, in an expression that uses `&&`, if the first operand in the expression is `false`, the compiler will stop there, and the entire value will be `false`.

<br>

# Logical NOT: !

The *unary* operator NOT, `!`, works on a single value. This operator evaluates to the **opposite** boolean to which itâ€™s applied:

```java
// true
!false

// false
!true
```

<br>

# Combining Conditional Operators

We have the ability to expand our boolean expressions by using multiple conditional operators in a single expression.

**Example**

```java
// true
boolean foo = true && !(false || !true)
```

The order of evaluation when it comes to conditional operators is as follows:

1. Parentheses - `()`
2. NOT - `!`
3. AND - `&&`
4. OR - `||`
